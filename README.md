# ☕ Coffee Machine Project (Python)

This is a beginner-level Python project where I built a coffee machine simulation
from scratch using basic concepts like:
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- Conditional statements
- Loops

The logic was brainstormed and implemented step by step to understand
how real-world systems manage resources and payments.

## Features
- Menu-based coffee selection
- Resource availability check (water, milk, coffee)
- Coin-based payment system
- Change return logic
- Report and machine off options

## What I learned
- Breaking a problem into smaller logical steps
- Writing cleaner functions
- Debugging logical errors instead of syntax errors

This project helped me understand Python logic more deeply.
